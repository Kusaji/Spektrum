# Spektrum
Rhythm game that does not require mapping.

Spektrum is based off my memories of playing Audio Surf, it was a fairly simple game where if my memory serves me correctly you can just drag songs into said game, and play them with no real mapping experience or anything along those lines. My goal is to create a game very similar to that, and add my own twist to it.

This project isn't anything serious for the time being, but as further development happens, I'll eventually start looking out for music producers who are looking to have their music featured in a gmae, nothing major.
